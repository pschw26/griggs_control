### TODO ###:

- adapt set valve positions dir for griggs pc 
- check for situations: 
		- s3 Motor is setting back position automatically? (after using set valve position before?!)
- check over Iteration-portion of the code again
- fully understand the directions: up down and so on (Maybe generalize for all?)
- Invert direction for s3?!
